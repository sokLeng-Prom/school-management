Stress is associated with the strength of the material from which the body is made, while strain is a measure of the deformation of the body. In addition to this, Structural Design in Architecture includes the study of the body’s stability when a body such as a column is subjected to compressive loading. A thorough understanding of the fundamentals of this subject is of vital importance because many concepts, phenomena, and formulae of structural engineering design are based upon the principles of this subject. Most importantly, it helps architects work with structural consultants and understand all the necessary considerations when designing structural systems. Finally, applications to simple structures are illustrated by a variety of examples. "
